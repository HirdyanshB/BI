# Netflix India Clone

This project is a simple **Netflix India Clone** that mimics the layout and functionality of the Netflix landing page. The webpage features a clean and responsive design, which includes a navigation bar, a language selector, an email entry form for membership sign-up, and an iconic background image typical of Netflix's homepage.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: This clone is built to be fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Navigation Bar**: The navbar includes the Netflix logo, a dropdown for language selection, and a "Sign In" button.
- **Background Image**: The homepage features a background image with a dark overlay, reflecting the signature look of Netflix's landing page.
- **Call-to-Action (CTA)**: The page includes a section where users can input their email to start or restart their Netflix membership, encouraging engagement.
- **Email Input Form**: The form collects email addresses to begin the membership process. This feature is styled with custom buttons and inputs.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: The page structure is built using HTML5, providing a clear and semantic layout.
- **CSS**: Custom styles are used to replicate the look and feel of the Netflix homepage. Flexbox is utilized for layout alignment, and media queries ensure responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: While the current version of the project does not include JavaScript, there is potential to enhance functionality (e.g., form validation, dynamic content, or additional interactivity).
